# Getting Started with this Task

# frontent
On the client side there's a README to run the react code

# backend
On the frontend run:
### `npm start`

1. If I had more time/resources:
- I'd write more queries for influx, hence adding more insights 
- refactor, optimize and add tests to the code
- Improve the UI/UX experience (the current one is too minimalistic)

2. I'd improve on this by automating the process even more and automated alerts from the insights 
(I'll think some more on this and provide a better proposal for this)

3. use AWS IoT Core & AWS Lmbda & AWS EC2
AWS Lambda Runs Code in Response to Events and Automatically Manages Resources. (utilize this more)
(I'll think some more on this and provide a better proposal for this)
